For support, the best thing to do is:
Use the [Issues](https://github.com/CTH999/InformationAgregator/issues) area for both [Bug Reports](https://github.com/CTH999/InformationAgregator/issues) and [Suggestions](https://github.com/CTH999/InformationAgregator/issues)

more stuff is planned. Eventually.
